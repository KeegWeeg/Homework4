<h2>Aspiring Software Developer</h2>
<hr>
<p1>Hello! My name is Keegan Lange. I am a second year student at NAU, majoring in Computer Science. I have been programming since High School, and have really enjoyed it. I am interested in music, I play piano, I am creative, and I am interning at a company for data analytics! For this course in particular, I am going to be very vigilant about using AI as a learning tool more then a crutch. I have noted in the last year a gross reliance on AI, and I feel like there has been a regression in my ability to write code without it. Besides that, I am excited for this course! </p1>
